For every communication system, there will always be error! 
The signal will be changed, always. 

Development of new services and advancements in technology drive traffic growth 

More newer and newer applications require more speed & bandwidth (also new applications require more bandwidth) 

When sending data: 
choose transmission media (like air or empty space for wireless) 
 - most wireless use radio frequency 
 - underwater use ultrasound (like 2 submarines)
 - could use sound (like person talking to computer, or old modems screeching) 
 - maybe mechanical waves like 

could also use wired 
 - mostly copper wire 
 - ethernet, coax, fiber optic 

modulation/demodulation scheme 

error detection, error control, flow control
- all communication has errors! This needs to be accounted for 
- flow control is to control speed e.g. if someone is talking much faster than someone else can understand 

Link Layer: 
 - error detection
 - error control 
 - flow control 

Physical layer: 
 - modulation/demodulation
 - transmission media
